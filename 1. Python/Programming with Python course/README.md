# Programming with Python
This repository has Python programs I made for the Programming with Python course:

1. <b>Sorting Lists program:</b> Create lists and compare sorting times based on their size
2. <b>Position and Velocity program:</b> Learn some Kinematics interacting with a position and velocity equation
3. <b>Slot Machine program:</b> Are you ready to try to have the highest score?
4. <b>Matrix program:</b> Create a matrix, put values inside it, apply a square or multiply function to all elements, transpose the matrix and print it
5. <b>Dictionary program:</b> Reads a words.txt file and creates a dictionary to find words inside it.
6. <b>Grade book program:</b> Create a grade book with students and assignments. Add a student or an assignment, look for a student, enter grade, delete assignment and print all students information.
7. <b>Grade book program version 2:</b> Offers the same Grade book program functionalities with some fixes and the code is more organized and implements classes.

## How can I run the programs? (except for expressions_evaluator_program)

1. Download the repository or the specific program you want to see.
2. Open your command line or terminal.
3. Go to the location where the program is inside your computer using the cd command.
4. Run the script (<b>UNIX:</b> python3 name_of_program.py <b>WINDOWS:</b> python name_of_program.py)

## How can I run expressions_evaluator_program?

1. Download the expressions_evaluator_program directory.
2. Open your command line or terminal.
3. Go inside the expressions_evaluator_program.
4. Run the script (<b>UNIX:</b> python3 run.py "command_arguments" <b>WINDOWS:</b> python run.py "command_arguments")

command_arguments has to be replaced by a mathematical expression such as (5+4), (5+4)*9, (5+4)*9^2 or (0.3+0.7)*2^2.

## Any recommended program?

Check out the Slot Machine,the Matrix, Grade book program version 2 and the Expressions evaluator program :)
