# Programming with Python
This repository has Python programs I made for the Programming with Python course:

1. <b>Sorting Lists program:</b> Create lists and compare sorting times based on their size
2. <b>Position and Velocity program:</b> Learn some Kinematics interacting with a position and velocity equation
3. <b>Slot Machine program:</b> Are you ready to try to have the highest score?
4. <b>Matrix program:</b> Create a matrix, put values inside it, apply a square or multiply function to all elements, transpose the matrix and print it

## How can I run the programs?

1. Download the repository or the specific program you want to see.
2. Open your command line or terminal.
3. Go to the location where the program is inside your computer using the cd command.
4. Run the script (<b>UNIX:</b> python3 name_of_program.py <b>WINDOWS:</b> python name_of_program.py)

## Any recommended program?

Check out the Slot Machine and the Matrix programs :)
